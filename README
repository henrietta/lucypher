1. How do I use it?

	First open lucypher.py and configure the settings. They are constants that begin with CONF_
	Then you can just call it as a program. Under Linux it will daemonize, under Windows you will have
	to play with Python interpreter to get rid of the console window.
	
2. What platform does it run on?

	- Windows (note that it probably needs Administrator access to access log files and serial port)
	- Linux (run under root)
	
3. What modules does it require?

	pySerial
	
4. What is it?

	This is a replacement daemon for software Orvaldi ships with some of it's UPS-es, notably those
	that require a perverse RS232 cable.
	
	Because the software they ship does not work, I have made mine version, so that I don't have to shell
	out cash for a new UPS :)

5. How do I shut it down the daemon?

	It is perfectly safe just to gun it.
	
6. Can I contact you for more info?

	Sure.
	
7. Why root under Linux?

	It's dead simple and I'm pretty sure it won't be used as an attack vector, although exercise caution to
	properly chmod the source file (world readable, owner writable).
	
	Besides, it needs privileges to shutdown -h now
